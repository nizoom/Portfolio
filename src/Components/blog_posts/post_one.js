      > This blog is to document my experience teaching myself to code. It has been a long journey so far and I think there is still a ways to go. That sense of trying to locate yourself along a track will be a perennial question during this process: where am I at on this road, what page have I gotten to within the infinite encyclopedia of code.

        To introduce myself my name is Nissim Ram and around February 2020 I quit my job as an immigration paralegal without knowing much about the software world but had seen enough that it looked interesting. <br /> <br /> Part of my job as a paralegal was to describe the skills of foreign workers who were hoping to work in the United States. Often, in the corporate sphere, I was working on visas for software engineers and had to prove to the government that the applicant’s skills were unique and of a high standard. The profile of these engineers became so common that it was impossible to ignore the value they brought to enterprises all over the country. Behind the static, application language describing the proprietary programs they built, was an image of a keen mind. A creator. Someone who could build tools using a secret tongue. I wanted in on that clandestine world I knew nothing about.
        <br /><br />
        However, it wasn’t just about learning a code. While visiting my friend Sam’s final project event for NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications Program, I was struck by the potential of what software could do. These were young people, learning the skills to not only work for Facebook or Amazon, but also tackling the problems those same companies had created (inadvertently or not). There were projects on media consumption, on climate change, and on many others. It was an extremely refreshing realization that this profession I was already curious about could be used to ameliorate social issues. Issues I had believed were important but hadn’t felt empowered to take on through a career. The inspiration of this moment has buoyed me throughout this journey, and I hope it will continue to do so.
        <br /><br />

        These ideas around how to apply this knowledge had to take a backseat for a while. I had to decide on how to start the process of learning to code. I hoped that these two strains of passion, on the one hand, and technical know-how, on the other, would be able to reunite later on. There wasn’t going to be a course on Udemy for projects around social change and technology. Mainstream self-teaching content has been about code, and what code you need to know to land a job. The main reference to real-world institutions that are connected to code are usually the big FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) companies. I am extremely grateful for this insider-information, and, at the same time, wonder where my own aspirations will take me on a complicated pipeline where many see FAANG as the pinnacle achievement, the last stop on the train.

        While this question persists over the days and weeks, a recurring thought keeps popping up: Well you’re going to have to learn a lot of this stuff regardless of where you work. And so, I got started picking a roadmap for self-teaching. <br /><br />The conventional wisdom from YouTube seemed to be, learn front-end languages so that you aren’t competing with graduates with CS degrees who will most likely be leveraging their backend expertise, honed over years of school. That made sense to me on a pragmatic level, but I wasn’t sure if I would necessarily like front-end more. I didn’t know what it entailed yet.

        YouTube was and remains a treasure trove of resources that can provide some general plan for self-teaching coders. These roadmaps give a broad picture of what is important to front-end development. They suggest to first learn HTML and CSS, the building blocks of the internet, and then move on to JavaScript. After getting comfortable with JavaScript, it would be a good idea to delve into the popular JavaScript framework, React. It sounded straight-forward enough: even if these were complicated subjects in and of themselves, at least there was an order to what should be learned. Once these four were complete then I should have a holistic skillset right? Not quite. <br /> <br /> When it comes to making a full stack application there seems to be countless technologies to learn. The roadmap didn’t account for all this and it can be overwhelming to see how far the path stretches beyond what you had initially anticipated.

        However, time in school and in the professional world had provided a valuable experience that helped manage expectations. In some ways the first introduction to a subject will be the point where your confidence is highest. You don’t yet know what you don’t know. Then you begin to hear new terms and vocabulary. The list of uncharted topics grows in your mind and you inevitably realize, wow there’s a lot more to this now than when I started. I’ve found this humbling connection to new interests repeating itself in many different subjects. Being patient and coming to terms with the feeling of being lost can serve you in good stead. That overbearing heaviness of what is left to learn is part of every mission to learn a new craft.<br /> <br />

        Over the course of learning little by little, I did find web development very enjoyable. As I got a handle on the basics, the realm of possible uses began to expand. Project ideas became important again as a way of not only showcasing capabilities, but also to return to what made me excited about programming in the first place. I was able to integrate my understanding of a social issue with a possible technological solution. This manifested in my first project which will be coming in the next month or so. It tries to demonstrate a new way of consuming news where, rather than sifting through a series of pre-made headlines, you can pick your news based on a point on a map. The hope is to offer an alternative to polarizing articles and US centric news.
        <br /> <br />
        I plan for this blog to be accessible to those both inside and outside the programming world. It will explore the different stages of learning to code, not so much as a how-to, but more to explain how these stages went and the challenges they posed.

        Stay tuned for upcoming projects and to hear more about my journey into web development!
