The user is presented with a world map and with a map click can learn about that place from a list of news articles generated from that location. The longitude and latitude from a map click is converted, using Google Cloud services, to a human readable address. The address is iterated through Azure's news API until relevant news appears. The user can also narrow their search by entering a keyword before clicking on the map. That key word will then be added to the parameters of the API query.</p>

Enter a Twitter handle and see all the most recent posts from their followers. The project utilizes Twitterâ€™s API to receive the data and then uses a Node backend to process the Tweets in chronological order. The result is a list of sequenced clickable Tweets.  A custom world cloud also consolidates all verbal content to demonstrate frequency of words. Using the app provides a more wholistic picture of that individual's interests and shared communities.</p>

I set up a daily cron job to hit an endpoint on an ExpressJS app. The Express app queries their donation widget API which responds with the donations from the day. The program will then define the gifts by donor category (new, recurring, monthly, and in tribute). The assessed data for each gift are passed to a corresponding email template based on the donation category. These templates were built with HTML, CSS, and Handlebars. My node application then sends the filled out the email to the donor. I am currently working on updating their CRM for each donation as well. </p>

Using a data base provided by NYC Open Data the user can filter building demolitions / constructions by year and borough on a location specific map. Each location is a clickable pin that displays the address, owner, and contracting company of the site. I Built an API to receive requests from the app which converts those requests into Socrata Query Language. This QL is used to fetch building data. Data visualizations are supplemented by charts that illustrate a breakdown of construction permits by type and construction trends for the last 30 years. </p>
